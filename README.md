===============

Stripped down example code and data for the [JIT (JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit)](http://thejit.org/) library.

Motivation
----------

The JIT's RGraph example has several HTML elements, two css stylesheets, a complex data set and a some optional RGraph settings in the JavaScript code. This is a minimal, stripped down example for quick reference.
